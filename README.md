# Used_car_price_prediction
ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and more.

We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data, discover patterns, and visualize key relationships. Then, we preprocess the dataset by encoding categorical features and splitting the data for model training.

A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict car prices based on historical data. The model is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE), along with a plot comparing actual vs predicted values.
