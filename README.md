# Used_car_price_prediction
ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and more.

We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data, discover patterns, and visualize key relationships. Then, we preprocess the dataset by encoding categorical features and splitting the data for model training.

A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict car prices based on historical data. The model is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE), along with a plot comparing actual vs predicted values.

This notebook is ideal for anyone learning about:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Machine Learning Regression models

Real-world use cases in the automobile industry  

#ðŸ§  **Objective**

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features like the car's age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership details. The goal is to assist individuals or businesses in understanding vehicle pricing trends and making data-driven pricing decisions.

**Methodology**
This project follows a complete data science workflow, including:

1 **Data Collection**

Real-world dataset containing used car listings with pricing details.

Dataset includes features such as car name, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, etc.

2 **Data Preprocessing**

Cleaning and encoding categorical variables.

Removing irrelevant or redundant columns.

Handling missing values (if any).

3 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Understanding feature distributions (e.g., selling price, fuel types).

Visualizing correlations between variables.

Outlier detection and feature importance.

4 **Model Building**

Features and target variable selection.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Training a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.

5 **Model Evaluation**

Evaluating model performance using:

ðŸ“‰ RÂ² Score (Goodness of Fit)

ðŸ“‰ Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices.

**Conclusion**

Final performance summary.

Real-world applicability of the model.
